       "u'About Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences (SICS) Established in 2007, the Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences (SICS) is a research institute within the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), and its mission is to develop clinical and translational research programmes in key disease areas. SICS is distinguished by its focus on clinical sciences and the use of innovative approaches and technologies that enable the efficient and effective study of human health and diseases. The clinical scientists in SICS conduct the full spectrum of \\x89\\xdb\\xcfbench to bedside\\x89\\xdb\\x9d research activities in metabolic diseases (including diabetes, obesity and insulin resistance), pathways to normal growth and development (including cognitive and behavioural development), and nutritional sciences. The institute aims to attract, train and nurture clinician-scientists and to develop joint programmes with universities, academic medical centres, government hospitals and research institutes. For more information about A*STAR and SICS, please visit www.a-star.edu.sg and www.sics.a-star.edu.sg respectively. The Data Manager should have experience managing databases and is expected to ensure efficient and effective operation and usage of data.

', u'Publishing or exchanging data sets is often hindered by privacy protection requirements and by the concern of disclosing too much information. This in turn leads to the fact that Open Data initiatives often suffer from data sparsity and that research, particularly in the smart mobility domain, cannot be evaluated using real data sets. The responsibilities of the Postdoctoral Researcher will be to provide a solution by developing novel methods for data holders to control both (i) privacy and (ii) usefulness of a data set before disclosing it. While privacy protection is certainly a necessity, it often comes at the cost of lowering the usefulness of the data. Within the project, we will investigate the applicability of existing obfuscation and sanitization methods (k- anonymity, l-diversity, t-closeness), as well as formal privacy methods (e.g., differential privacy) to Singapore mobility data. By extending these methods with a utility parameter, we will allow data holders to control both the level of detail and privacy included in the data set. The project is co-hosted between NTU Singapore and TUM Create, and the hired personnel will be expected to liaise the research activities across the two organizations. PhD.

Our strategic thrusts are in the spheres of intelligence, communications and media and our research capabilities are in shared sensor networks, public-public/public-private data-sharing platform, big data analytics and visualization solutions. For more information about I2R, please visit www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg We are looking for strong candidates in the field of Artificial intelligence and deep learning, with an interest in working on both fundamental algorithms in large-scale machine learning or deep learning, and also applying it to practical problems in vertical domains. The position, based within the Program in Artificial Intelligence at I2R, entails working closely with a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with training from leading universities like MIT, Stanford and CMU. Listed below are problems of interest in the Deep Learning 2.0 project: Multimodal Deep Learning:Towards effective learning from heterogeneous data sources Currently, deep learning is applied in various areas such as visual computing, speech recognition, text mining, etc. In each area, the learning model is trained with large amounts of data in isolation. A multimodal learning approach from heterogeneous data sources, including video, speech, text, etc. is necessary to achieve breakthrough in performance.  Unsupervised Deep Learning:Towards 10X fewer labeled samples Labeling large amounts of training data is one of the most time-consuming steps in the deep learning pipeline, and is often not feasible. The aim is to achieve the same performance with 10x fewer labeled training samples. This is a strong step in the direction of unsupervised deep learning, where representations are learnt with large amounts of unlabeled unstructured data. Deep Learning on Embedded Devices:Towards 100X smaller models Current deep learning models have 10s of millions of neurons, making it infeasible for deployment on mobile and embedded hardware. The aim is to achieve models that are 100x smaller, with little loss in performance. This capability will also be critical for emerging neuromorphic platforms, where the number of spiking neurons is orders of magnitude smaller than in current state-of-the-art deep learning models. Online Deep Learning:Towards Near Real Time (NRT) model updates State-of-the-art deep learning models still take several days to train on expensive GPU infrastructure. A common problem is when new data (including new classes) are constantly added to an evolving, always-learning system. Algorithms to move towards real-time updates will be essential. Extreme Deep Learning:Training 1B neural networks efficiently The high model capacity of deep networks is why increasing amounts of data and model size improves performance. However, there are substantial challenges in hardware and algorithms challenges in training very large models efficiently. The aim is to address these challenges to achieve more efficient training. Deep Learning for Spoken Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding: Towards better modeling of human communication Language technology has made great advances through deep learning in the past five years, penetrating fields such as speech recognition and machine translation. However, there are still numerous challenges that need to be addressed, ranging from the requirement of specialized linguistic resources to large amounts of annotated data, and to insufficient theoretical grounding in deep learning. This aim attempts to address challenges that are often overlooked by major commercial AI players. White-Box Deep Learning:Towards interpretable and contextually informed models Current deep learning models are largely black-boxes that are not informed by contextual relations and provide little intuition. Improved abilities to regulate the learning process, and interpret the resulting predictions will be essential for the next wave of AI applications -- especially for complex learning scenarios and applications involving critical decisions. Incorporating Knowledge Graphs into Deep Learning:Towards better understanding of images Current deep learning systems today have no real understanding of images, with output typically a bunch of bounding boxes, learnt using a large number of label or sentence-level associations. Knowledge graphs like the MIT ConceptNet will be used to understand higher-level semantics and relationships between entities, to improve classification accuracy.
